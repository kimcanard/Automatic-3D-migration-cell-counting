# Automatic-3D-migration-cell-counting
Automatized cell counting from 3D tranwell migration assay. Macro made from scratch with Fiji sotware in Java. Enables processing of images (while keeping source images), counting of cell number and size. 
Pre-requisite include images of cells at 4x after after fixation and staining with violet crystal. This macro was tested on images taken with ZEISS Microscope Software ZEN (even though AxioVision software is recommended to avoid crashes and hours of pain and blood tears). To be announced.
